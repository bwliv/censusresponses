    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hard to count\" is a popular buzzphrase as the 2020 US Census takes shape - but what does it mean for your region?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a journalist, you probably have a great feel for your area's demographic makeup, and which groups *might* be particularly hard-to-count - but it's difficult to quantify.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NewsCounts* has built a workflow that will allow you to do this - **and we're prepared to tailor it for your newsroom using both 2010 and up-to-date 2020 data.** It's an easy, compelling template for a story on demographics and census response rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the way the public engages with the census has changed significantly from 2010 to 2020, between the [addition of an online response option in 2020](https://2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond.html), [the outbreak of COVID-19](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/update-on-2020-census-field-operations.html), and the evolution of the nation and its government over the last ten years.\n",
    "\n",
    "By compiling demographic and response data from the 2010 and 2020 censuses, we have developed an idea of what makes various areas hard-to-count, and are prepared to tailor this analysis for your newsroom and its audience."

    "## What We'll Do Here\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by examining which factors made the nation as a whole hard-to-count in 2010, and then compare it to what appears to be happening in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will look at basic tract-level data from the 2010 decennial census and five-year American Community Survey estimates from 2010 and 2018, and use them as a means of modeling exactly *why* America's 50 states (plus the District of Columbia) seemed to be hard-to-count in 2010, and seem to be hard-to-count in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then move to a more granular analysis that demostrates how the story might change in your local area, and how you can tell that story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we won't be able to say whether response rates are generally higher or lower overall quite yet, as this year's census is far from complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the census' new daily response data is extremely valuable for articles. If you need that up-to-date response rate information to pair with this, there's information on obtaining it [at the end of this guide](#Contact-Info-&amp;-Other-Resources)."

    "## Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish our goal, we used two highly interpretable models that allow us to glean which demographic factors correlate most with counting difficulties:\n",
    "* A basic linear model that simply calculates the linear correlation between each demographic factor and undercounting\n",
    "* A simple tree model that finds which factors have the biggest impact in determining why areas are hard to count\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then present the weights from these models to determine which factors are most important - first the correlation coefficients for the linear model, then the variable importances from the tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Nuts & Bolts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlations** estimate how much response rates increase (positive correlation) or decrease (negative correlation) based on the increased presence of a certain subgroup. They range on a constant scale from -1 (perfectly negatively correlated), to 0 (absolutely no linear correlation), to 1 (perfectly positively correlated). These are just linear (Pearson) correlations, so they only measure linear relationships - it's possible a relationship could exist even if we don't conclude one does here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a correlation would need to be at or above .3 or at or below -.3 for us to consider it anything more than weak - but given that most of the groups we're referring to are minorities, we can likely lower that threshold to account for their limited ability to impact response rates as a whole. If, say, a subgroup makes up only 30% of the population, it's unreasonable to expect it to have a drastic impact on overall response rates, and a correlation of .2 may be quite telling (more on this in the caveats section below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about correlations that is **great** for articles is this: if you square them, you get the percent of the variation in response rates that can be explained by the presence of that subgroup alone (again assuming that simple linear model).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we'll later see that there's a positive 0.72 correlation between presence of people making over \\\\$75,000 and census response rates in Maryland. This means that 52\\% (over half!) of the variation in tract response rates in Maryland could be predicted based simply on the proportion of people making over \\\\$75,000 in a given tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Feature importances**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.feature_importances_) indicate how important a demographic factor is towards determining how hard-to-count an area is relative to other factors. They place a higher priority on weighting the most important factors - unlike correlations, which treat the factors independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrap p-values** estimate the probability that we would see the correlations we got in 2020 if nothing had changed since 2010. If they're zero (or close to zero), it suggests that the relationship between prevalence of that group and census response rates has changed since 2010. The *lower* the p-value, the more significant the change. We'll use a 95% level of significance with a two-sided alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, our p-values tell us whether or not to reject the null hypothesis that there was no change in a correlation, not actually say that there was a definitive increase or decrease - but for simplicity, we'll label our results as \"increase\", \"decrease\", or \"no change.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, it's very important to note that these results can partially be traced to the relative sizes of certain subgroups in tracts. Larger subgroups will have naturally have a bigger impact on response rates, so comparing the magnitudes of these results across subgroups isn't particularly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the impacts of the presence of American Indian / Alaska Native populations seem small, but they are actually difficult to ignore: they are surprisingly large given that this group has a national population of less than 5 million. Later, we will see how these impacts grow in an area with a larger AIAN population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, because we have weighted all tracts equally, this analysis will inherently put more emphasis on the characteristics of communities in less populous tracts. However, approximately 95% of census tracts have a population between 1,400 and 7,300, so we don't believe this will introduce extreme bias into our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we are using ACS estimates from 2018 for our 2020 results, and a mix of decennial census numbers and ACS estimates for 2010; this is the best data we have for each period, but it admittedly isn't gospel truth, and the 2020 numbers are a little more of an estimation than the 2010 numbers."

    "\n",
    "Examining the national results, it is abundantly clear across the board that socioeconomic factors correlate heavily with undercounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find a fairly substantial positive correlation between higher income and a higher likelihood of filling out a census form, and the white- and Asian-heavy areas are filling out census forms more frequently than areas with more African-Americans, Hispanics, and native populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "More populous, urban areas had higher return rates, as did areas with more minors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While things appear to have changed significantly for nearly every group since 2010, it appears that Hispanic- and non citizen-heavy areas are replying at a noticeably lower clip in 2020, which many feared after the White House's attempt to [add a citizenship question](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/trump-census-citizenship-question.html) to this year's census.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also appears that areas with fewer high-school educated residents and more impoverished residents tend to respond at a lower rate in 2020 than they did in 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, it appears areas that are black-heavy are still having noticeable issues with undercounting, but this data suggests that perhaps those issues are, on the average, not quite as bad as in 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our tree model identified economic status and education as the most important factors in determining responses - but it's possible that these are simply proxies for more granular socioeconomic differences.\n",

    "# How We Can Help\n",
    "\n",
    "*NewsCounts* can help you run this analysis for your state (or possibly even county if it's large enough), and determine which factors correlated with undercounting there. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by looking back at 2010, and go in-the-moment and look at why it might be happening right now in 2020, and whether things are getting better or worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is *very* easy for us to pop out these same numbers for just about any level of US geography with a FIPS code. We can do it almost instantaneously - just ask!\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also quite open to incorporating new data. There are thousands of data points we can add if you feel another demographic factor might be good for modeling why your region is hard-to-count. Drop us a note if you have an idea, and we'll make an analysis that works for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running This Analysis For Yourself (if you want to try!)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're very happy to do this for you, but if you prefer getting your hands on this tool yourself (and you're familiar with Jupyter), just follow these steps and you should be able to replicate this for your area (or multiple areas) in just minutes:\n",
    "1. Download the notebook from [this project's repo](https://github.com/bwliv/censusresponses/blob/master/undercount_modeling.ipynb) by hitting \"raw\" and then \"save as\", or fork the repo and run the notebook from there\n",
    "2. Run all this notebook's cells as-is (they should take about five minutes to run)\n",
    "3. Add and run a block with the code *show_area(--fips--)*, where --fips-- is the FIPS code of the [state](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/?cid=nrcs143_013696) or [county](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697) you want to look up.\n",
    "4. Voilà! You have your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact Info & Other Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to email [benjamin.livingston@columbia.edu](mailto:benjamin.livingston@columbia.edu) or post on the NewsCounts Slack channel (email Benjamin for an invite!) any time if you'd like us to help you get started with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Census Bureau is tracking 2020 response rates and provides [a wonderful map with up-to-date data](https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates.html). *NewsCounts* also provides a [beta dashboard](https://newscounts.appspot.com/) and [API](https://bernacho.github.io/NewsCounts-ResponseRatesAPI/API_documentation.html) that allows you to grab the daily response data for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "[CUNY's hard-to-count map](https://www.censushardtocountmaps2020.us/) is an excellent resource for a general look back at which areas were hard-to-count in 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't hesistate to reach out with any census reporting-related questions. We recognize this spring is a challenging time for journalists, and we're here to make covering this pivotal census easier for you."
