    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hard to count\" is a popular buzzphrase as the 2020 US Census takes shape - but what does it mean for your region?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a journalist, you probably have a great idea of your area's demographic makeup, and what groups *might* be particularly hard-to-count - but it's difficult to quantify.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NewsCounts* has built a tool that will allow you to do this - **and we're prepared to tailor it for your newsroom using both 2010 and up-to-date 2020 data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "By compiling demographic and mail response data from the 2010 and 2020 censuses, we've developed a model for what makes an area hard-to-count, and are prepared to tailor it to your newsroom."

    "## What We'll Do Here\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by examining which factors made the nation as a whole hard-to-count in 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will look at basic tract-level data from the 2010 decennial census and five-year American Community Survey estimates (also from 2010), and use them as a means of modeling exactly *why* America is hard-to-count.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then move to a more granular analysis that demostrates how the story might change in your local area, and how you can tell that story."

   "source": [
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we used three highly interpretable models that allow us to glean which demographic factors correlate most with counting difficulties:\n",
    "* A basic linear model that simply calculates the linear correlation between each demographic factor and undercounting\n",
    "* A simple tree model that finds which factors have the biggest impact in determining why areas are hard to count\n",
    "* A five-feature random forest model, a more stabilized tree model that considers how different combinations of demographic factors might impact undercounting\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then present the weights from these models to determine which factors are most important - first the correlation coefficients for the linear model, then the variable importances from the two tree models."
